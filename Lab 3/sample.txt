In our last lab, we demonstrated how to utilize our basic logic gates to create full adders, and thus were able to sum binary numbers together using a circuit.
For this lab we are provided with an integrated circuit chip that actually performs all the adding and carrying involved in a full-adder circuit within the chip.
Previously, we were performing only addition with the adder circuit, but we are now asked to perform subtraction with the same circuit.
How does one accomplish that?
This is where our knowledge on subtracting binary numbers comes into play.
We have learned that in order to perform subtraction on binary numbers, the standard procedure is to convert the subtrahend to its 2s-complement form.
We then perform addition as you would on any two binary numbers.
As an example, if you have A - B, you would first convert B to its 2s-complement form by inverting it and adding 1.
Then you would perform addition in the form of A + (-B).
Once the addition has been completed you have one of two scenarios: the output number is positive, producing an end carry, which you drop.
Or the output number is negative, so you perform 2s-complement on it and append a negative sign.
